A place to review and study prework

## Description

This repository provides a useful resource for studying information learned in the prework. The repository will be  separated by topic/language and will serve as an essential tool for studying. The repository will serve as a better alternative to hand written notes, as information can be accessed/stored in one place quickly. I think one of my biggest obstacles is staying organized. I am confident that the tools I acquire in the bootcamp will be utilized in every repo. 
In the prework I recieved a taste of what's to come in the bootcamp. I got a small taste of:
Git/GitHub
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
